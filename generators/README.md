## About the generators ðŸ”ƒ

The purpose of this directory is to create a system for automatic updating of the results, as new races take place. Lap times are updated from the Ergast page, while results, pit stops data and other tables are updated from the official formula 1 page. For more information, visit each of the scripts individually.

To use any generator in your machine, you must have Python 3 installed (tested only in version 3.10), and install the necesary requirements (in the first cell of the notebook). You can run the Jupyter Notebook from VScode, by pressing the "Run All" button.

> In case the Ergast API is discontinued in the future, the lap times would be discontinued (they could be extracted from the FIA documents but it would require quite complex scraping)
