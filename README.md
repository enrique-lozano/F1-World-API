## Run the API locally üöÄ

The following explains how to run the API locally. This way you will be able to investigate on your own how it is done, create new features, fix bugs or use it in your projects.

### Prerequisites

The API has developed in Node and TypeScript, so you will need to have installed Node. Consult [here](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) your installation options. Additionally, it is recommended (but not necessary) to have git installed on your device

### Installation

Open a terminal on your computer and go to the folder where you want to place the project. Then clone the project and install the dependencies by typing the following commands:

```
git clone https://github.com/enrique-lozano/F1-World-API.git
```

```
cd F1-World-API
```

> Instead of this steps, you could also download the zip of the repo from GitHub and open a terminal in the extracted zip file.

After this steps, with the terminal pointing to the project directory, install the required dependencies by typing in it the following command:

```
npm install
```

If everything went correctly these commands will finish executing without errors.

### Create the database in SQLite

Now you will have to create and populate the database on your machine, otherwise when running the API it will not find any data. To do this, run the following commands:

```
npm run import-db
```

### Start the server

Now you are already finishing! It only remains to prove that everything goes as it should. For that, you can run <code>npm run start</code> on your terminal. When this command finish, you can start receiving data from the API. Try to put http://localhost:3200/api/drivers/adrian-sutil in your favorite browser. You should see how the information of this driver in JSON format is shown:

To see the avalaible routes (or API calls) that you can access, you can go to our [swagger documentation](http://localhost:3200/api/docs). Here you will have described all the calls you can make, their parameters, etc.
